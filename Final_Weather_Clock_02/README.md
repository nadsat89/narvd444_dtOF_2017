Week 8 MIDTERM.Readme File
The midterm is a basic application, also inspired by the Pixar Movie "UP". The Goal is to take the house to the top of the cliff (right on top of the waterfall) by adding and exploding balloons (position y is being affected by gravity and liftForce). It's also possible to change direction by tapping the arrows, or explode all balloons at once by tapping "k".

Week 5 Homework UPDATE. Readme File
This is the Update of Week #5. In this week, I created an animation inspired by the "titles" of the Pixar Logo.
I animated the Pixar Lamp "Luxo" to jump throughout the screen. In this case I used a png image. Originally I created the lamp itself in openFramworks using ofVertex + ofDrawLine; but I found it really hard to control with variables. In contrast, for the png file, I just had the variables of position, width and height.

Week 3 Homework UPDATE. Readme File

This is the Update of Week #3. I already did the update of week 2 but I thought It wasn't neccesary adding a readme file (it's a quite intuitive interaction).
On this case, I just want to tell you what I did.
I created a basic portrait in Illustrator in order to reference the coordinate systems. I wanted to draw ALL the shapes using openFrameworks,
thats why I used ofBeginShape - ofVertex - ofEndShape to create the paths.
Then I created a couple of interactions. First, having the ability to change the location of the eyes, and then the color of the hair (random color+alpha channel)
and finally the movement of the mouth to create the illusion of 'talking'.
