# FINAL PROJECT- Weather API - Night Stand Weather Projector-

## Dario Narvaez

The project aimed to use physical objects, in this case a night stand, in order to make it alive by usign the tools
of openFrameworks and coding in general. 

The edge of the night stand works as the horizon of the projection. The weather changes live with the connection of the API.

I used Yahoo Weather API, taking time, location, temperature and "code" (current weather state such as "snow-weather" or "rainy weather").
I mapped the sunrise and sunset time to the rotation 360 degrees of the sun and the moon. This icons change accourding to the state.
For instance, if the weather is rainy, drop particles will animate genrating the effect, same for the snow, but in this case, with the snow also bulding up in the "ground" with the passing of time.
