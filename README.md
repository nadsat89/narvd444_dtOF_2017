Week 3 Homework UPDATE. Readme File

This is the Update of Week #3. I already did the update of week 2 but I thought It wasn't neccesary adding a readme file (it's a quite intuitive interaction).
On this case, I just want to tell you what I did.
I created a basic portrait in Illustrator in order to reference the coordinate systems. I wanted to draw ALL the shapes using openFrameworks,
thats why I used ofBeginShape - ofVertex - ofEndShape to create the paths.
Then I created a couple of interactions. First, having the ability to change the location of the eyes, and then the color of the hair (random color+alpha channel)
and finally the movement of the mouth to create the illusion of 'talking'.
